## Project overview

### Goal

To determine the most commonly misidentified bee species in Canada and uncover what makes these species more difficult to identify using the iNaturalist database.

### Context

The iNaturalist database is comprised of citizen science identification contributions and is commonly used by conservation authorities, park planners, and researchers alike. An existing problem with the iNaturalist database is that observations may be misidentified by users even if the entry is deemed to be "Research Grade". We want to determine if certain species or taxonomic groups are more likely to be misidentified by iNaturalist users and what may bias these groups towards misidentification using bees within Canada as a case study.
